The knowledge of\r\n                the shipping workflow will enable me to answer the questions\r\n                what are activities that must be captured in the Audit Trail.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Each client has the ability to create a custom workflow that\r\n                fits their specific needs or processes. With a large number of\r\n                clients, there is a high number of variations in the workflow\r\n                that each client chooses to follow at their site. To understand\r\n                the overall shipping process, I interviewed Nulogy's\r\n                professional service consultant, who ho work directly with\r\n                clients to provide training and technical supports.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                After several interviews with multiple consultants, a\r\n                low-fidelity user workflow is created by grouping sticky notes\r\n                based on category of tasks and their hierarchical order\r\n              </p>\r\n              <img\r\n                src={this.getImageUrl(\"research.jpg\")}\r\n                alt=\"Work Breakdown Structure of Craft Beer Ordering System\"\r\n                className=\"img-fluid\"\r\n              />\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"10\">\r\n              <h3>Second Round of User Workflow Research</h3>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"10\">\r\n              <p>\r\n                The second round of interview is conducted to fill the gap of\r\n                missing information from the previous round. It is useful to\r\n                understand more about extreme cases and problems that can happen\r\n                after a shipment is shipped. Some potential problems due to\r\n                human errors include sending a shipment to a wrong destination\r\n                or sending wrong items. In these cases, any past record related\r\n                to the shipment is needed for further investigation to rectify\r\n                the situation.
