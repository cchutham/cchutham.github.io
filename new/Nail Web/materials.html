      Tools and Supplies
       </h1>
       <a name="NailPolish"></a>
       <h2>&clubs; Nail Polish</h2>
      Of course! this is the most essential supply you must have in order to do nail art.  Two important kinds of nail polish are base coat and colored polishes. The base coat is actually the most important one because it protects your nails from chemicals in the colored nail polish.  There are various bands of nail polish. I personally find out that the price doesn't really affect the quality of it. My suggestion is to not spend a lot of money on nail polish just because you think the expensive ones are better. You should try to buy various bands and find which one you like the most.

    <h3> &clubs; Nail Polish Review</h3>
    Many of you may have a hard time making a decision what brands of nail polish you should buy. I have some information and opinions of the brands I have tried before here! 
    <br>
    <br>
    &hearts; OPI/Nicole/Sephora 
    <br>
    Price Range: $7-11
    <br>
    Basically, these three bands are manufactured by OPI, so I feel that their qualities should be the same. It's pretty obvious  that OPI is a very popular nail polish brand. Tons of colors and high quality are the best characteristic of this nail polish. Still, it is quite expensive, compared with other brands. If you have a limited budget or don't want to spend a lot of money on nail polish, I'll recommend you to get only the base coat from this brand.
    <br>
    <br>
    &hearts; Revlon
    <br>
    Price Range: $5-11
    <br>
    Revlon is another brand that I really like. I usually used the normal colored polishes, which cost almost $5 (if you get it from Walmart). It has a lots of colors, but less than OPI, good quality, and cheap.  
    <br>
    <br>
    &hearts; Sally Hanson
    <br>
    Price Range: $3-10
    <br>
    Another famous manicure brand. It has various type of nail polishes. I only like the complete salon collection, which costs around $7 (Walmart price again) for each of them. Hard as nails Xtream wear collection is okay for me, but I don't really like it. The collection Hard as Nail is really bad. l don't like the brush, and I feel that it never gives a smooth looking when I apply it on my nails. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &hearts; Skin Food
    <br>
    Price Range: N/A
    <br>
    This is a Korean brand nail polish, so I don't really know where you can get it in Canada. Well, you can try looking it online, but I'm not sure about the price though. (From Korean Won price, it costs about $2-3) I put this brand on the list just because it's my most favorite nail polish 's brand. It's cheap,  really good, dry fast, and gives a perfect looking on your nails! 
    <br>
    <br>
    &hearts; Sinful Color 
    <br>
    Price: $2
    <br>
    This is another brand of my favorite. Target is the only place in Canada I know you can get this brand. They don't have many colors sold here though, but there are a lot of colors sold in the States. This brand is not only cheap, but its quality is also really amazing. It doesn't make your nails turn yellow if you leave it on them for a while. It also lasts pretty long. I would say that you can use this brand instead of Skin Food since the price and quality are much the same.

    <a name="NailRemover"></a>
    <h2>&clubs; Nail remover</h2>
    Basically, it is used to remove what you've painted on your nails.
    <br>
    <a name="CottonPads"></a>
    <h2>&clubs; Cotton pads</h2>
    Cotton pads are used when you want to remove nail polish from your nails.
    <br>
    <a name="CottonSwabs"></a>
    <h2>&clubs; Cotton Swabs</h2>
    Cotton swabs are not very necessary, but they are used to decorate and clean some tiny details on your nails. 
    <br> 
    <a name="Brush"></a>
    <h2>&clubs; Dotting Tool and Painting brush</h2>
  Dotting tool is for making dot or creating some shapes on your nails.
  <br>
  Painting brush is also important as you will need it to draw the arts.
  You can get these two item from cosmetic store like Sephora (I got it in2013 for $10) or you may fine them cheaper if you get them online.
