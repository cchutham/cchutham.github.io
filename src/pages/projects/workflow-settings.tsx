                PlanGrid’s primary objective is to make intuitive and impactful
                technology for people in the construction industry. Its
                construction productivity software doesn’t only allow field
                workers to store, view, and share blueprints, but also enable
                stakeholders in the project to work together throughout the
                project life cycle.

              <p className={sharedStyles.quote}>
                The design workshop plays an important roles to gather ideas
                from the co-op students. Since they will be wearing the t-shirt,
                it's crucial for me to have them involved in the design process.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the design workshop, I asked the co-op students to write
                down ideas or words that popped up in their mind when thinking
                about PlanGrid and the University of Waterloo. Everyone in the
                workshop had the word "geese" in their list as they are so many
                geese around the university campus. Concepts of hard hat, campus
                building, and construct your future also showed up as PlanGrid
                creates software for the construction industry. Other ideas such
                as maple leaf, US and Canada maps also appeared in the workshop.

              <p>
                In crazy 8's exercise, I asked the students to convert the ideas
                that they brainstormed earlier into drawings. They had to sketch
                a total of 8 pictures, and they only had a one minute to sketch
                each of them. The activity turned to be quite challenging for
                these students because they didn't participate in design
                workshop often. There were times when students hesitated to draw
                because they were scared that their pictures would look ugly.
                There were also some students who gave up drawing as they ran
                out of ideas. To maintain the energy level in the room, I had to
                gave them some of the keywords generated in the brainstorming
                sessions as well as to emphasize them to focus on the ideas
                rather than the look of their drawings.

              <p>
                Before I started sketching the illustration, I spent some time
                looking for inspiration on the internet. I was looking for
                pictures of Waterloo geese, university campus buildings, Bob the
                Builder, and San Francisco landmark like the Golden Gate Bridge.

                Once I got enough inspiration, I began to sketch the designs.
                During this process, a lot of my sketches tended to revolve
                around the concept of Waterloo geese since it was the design
                that got requested the most.

                Because of this, my mentor taught me a double diamond design
                process, from which I learned to explore different designs and
                narrowed down to ones that would work for this project. I
                adopted this method and came up with three different designs:
                the goose, the buildings, and the plain text.
