                PlanGrid has a primary objective to make intuitive and impactful
                technology for people in the construction industry. Its
                construction productivity software doesn’t only allow field
                workers to store, view, and share blueprints, but also enables
                stakeholders in a project to work together throughout the
                project life cycle.

              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                Admin Console is a part of PlanGrid web products that allows IT
                administrators to add, remove, and manage user accounts as well
                as to purchase PlanGrid licenses for users who involve in
                organization projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                PlanGrid offers multiple types of licenses, and each comes with
                a different number of sheet storage limit. The licenses range
                from basic ones that come with limited sheet storage to the most
                expensive one that allows unlimited sheet storage.

              <h3>My Roles &amp; Project Goals</h3>
              <p>
                The main goals of this project are to enhance user experience
                for the Admin Console and to create an additional workflow that
                allows the IT admins to set up organization ownership of user
                accounts. As a designer, I design the workflow that will give IT
                admins an ability to manage user accounts and redesign web
                interfaces using components from PlanGrid's Design System.

              <h3>Problems</h3>
              <p className={sharedStyles.quote}>
                The current system restricts IT Admins to only purchase licenses
                from a user log page. It also limits their capability to
                effectively monitor license usage as they are unable to access a
                list of projects that their users are working on.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first problem occurs when IT Admins finds out they don't
                have enough license when trying to add new users to the
                organization. The current process requires them to abandon their
                current task, navigate back to the user log page, purchase
                licenses and repeat the process of adding new users.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second problem happens when employees request for a license
                upgrade when they run out of sheet storage. Since the IT admins
                can't see list of projects that the employees are working on,
                it's challenging to know if the extra storage is required for
                company work. It is possible that the employees use company
                license to work on their personal or freelance projects. As a
                result, the company has to unnecessary pay extra to upgrade
                licenses for these employees.

              <h3>The Current Admin Console</h3>
              <p>
                The current version of Admin Console consists of two major
                components: a license usage box and a table that displays a list
                of people working on company projects. The IT admins can click
                "add license" button to buy more licenses and click "new users"
                button to add more people to the organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                From a design perspective, not every part of the Admin Console
                is built using components from PlanGrid’s design system. For
                example, the “more options icon” at the end of the row of user
                log doesn’t exist in other parts of PlanGrid web app.

                To make it's easier to understand the process, I created a
                simplified version of the user flow. In the diagram, an IT admin
                can add new users or manage the existing users. If he decides to
                manage a user, he’ll send a request to manage the user account.
                If he just wants the user to work on company projects, he’ll
                send an invitation to the user to join the organization. On the
                other end, the user can accept or reject the request or the
                invitation.

                In an early stage of the design process, I sketched wireframes
                to get a general idea of what components would look like in each
                step of the user flow.

                Since the current version of Admin Console didn't comply with
                PlanGrid's design system, I designed a high fidelity prototype
                using most components that already exist in the design system
                library. Some designs were completely changed to minimize future
                design work. For example,

              <p>1. The modal box for add new user flow</p>
              <p>
                The current design of the modal box requires the IT admins to
                scroll back and forth to view license options and email
                addresses they've entered. By adding account management section
                to the box, its height will increases even more. Since the modal
                box handles a goal-oriented task, the endless scrolling in the
                current design might prevent the IT admins to quickly accomplish
                their tasks. As a result, I decided to explore a new design
                pattern that would solve the endless scrolling problem. I
                divided the box into 2 columns and placed the account management
                section on the left side and the license option to the right
                side.

                Currently, the IT admins can only purchase licenses from a user
                log page. They will have to abandon the add new users flow to go
                back to the user log and purchase additional licenses before
                being able to add new users. This process can waste their time
                and increase their frustration level. Therefore, I'm designing a
                workflow and user interfaces that will allow the IT admins to
                buy additional licenses without having to discard the entire
                process.
