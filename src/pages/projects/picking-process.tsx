              <p>
                The warehouse picking process normally involves forklift
                operators picking up items from one location and drop them off
                at another location. Currently, the forklift operators can only
                pick up one pallet at a time due to the restriction of the
                software that Nulogy provides. This can slow down the picking
                process as the forklift operators have to make multiple trips to
                pick up items until they fulfill the picking list. To increase
                efficiency to their workflow, I decided to review the shipping
                process and designed a feature that would allow them to pick up
                multiple items at once.

              <p>
                I began my design process by interviewing Nulogy's professional
                service consultants, who worked directly with the workers at the
                manufacturing site. After multiple rounds of interviews, I was
                able to collect sufficient information to summarize the general
                workflow of the forklift operator. I then was assigned to create
                a user journey map using the information that I got from the
                interview sessions.

              <p>
                Designing a user journey map was challenging for me since I've
                never designed one before. With the information from interview
                sessions, I planned to create a user journey map that shows
                forklift operator's thoughts and his interaction with other
                workers. However, I found it to be really difficult to create a
                balance between text and graphic contents. As a result, this is
                what it looked like in the first iteration. Yes, it was this
                ugly...

              <p>
                I have to admit that the result from iteration one made me
                panic. I was really concerned of how I would put things
                together. After thinking over and over, I finally came up with a
                new design. Majority of graphic contents were removed in the
                second iteration, making the page look a lot cleaner than it was
                in the first iteration.

                responsibility, goals and key people. The body section of the
                map covers the workflow of the forklift driver, and the last
                section shows pain points that the forklift driver commonly
                undergoes.

              <p>
                In the final version of the user journey map, the title
                "forklift driver" was replaced with "forklift operator", and
                icons for key people were replaced with colored dots with
                initials of their position. This was done to reduce mental
                workload for the audience as they wouldn't have to remember
                which icon represent which person. The existence of the user
                journey map allows the product designers to understand the
                workflow of the forklift operators as well as their goals and
                pain points, making the solutions designed to be more
                user-centered.

              <p>
                To increase efficiency in picking process for forklift
                operators, a simple solution is designed to allow the forklift
                operators to pick up multiple pallets at once. From the
                interface below, we can see that from step 5 to step 6, the
                users have an option to pick up more pallet or to drop off
                pallet(s) that they currently have on their forklift.

              <h3>Next Steps.</h3>
              <p>
                While this problem seemed to be resolved by adding a feature
                that allows the forklift operator to pick up multiple pallets at
                a time, there are other issues that need to be considered.

                <i>
                  <b>
                    "What is the maximum number of pallets that can be picked at
                    once?"
                  </b>
                </i>
                <br />
                This question was asked by both myself when designing the
                feature and the professional service consultants when I
                presented them this prototype. It's good to allow multiple
                pallets to be picked at once, but some limitation should still
                exist to prevent any potential error. Still, the maximum number
                can be varied, depending on the workflow of each warehouse. Some
                warehouses might want their forklift operators to pick up only
                one pallet at a time. Therefore, the product team still needs to
                consider if a single number will be set up as a maximum number
                or the maximum number can be customized by each warehouse.
              </p>

              <p>
                <i>
                  <b>
                    "Can we redesign the entire picking process experience so
                    that it's more user friendly?"
                  </b>
                </i>
                <br />
                I consider the addition of this feature as a first step to
                improve user experience for picking process. However, I was
                mainly focusing to solve the pallet picking up issue, there is
                very minimal UI design in the prototype shown in a previous
                section.
