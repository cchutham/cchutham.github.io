                The warehouse picking process normally involves forklift
                operators picking up items from one location and drop them off
                at another location. Currently, the forklift operators can only
                pick up one item/pallet at a time due to the restriction of the
                software that Nulogy provides. This restriction can slow down
                the picking process as the forklift operators have to make
                multiple trip to pick up items that are located in the same
                location. To increase efficiency to their workflow, I decided to
                review the shipping process and designed a feature that would
                allow them to pick up multiple items at once.

              <h3>User Research.</h3>
              <p>
                I began my design process by interviewing Nulogy's professional
                service consultants, who worked directly with the workers at the
                manufacturing site. After multiple rounds of interviews, I was
                able to collect sufficient information to summarize the general
                workflow of the forklift operator. I then was assigned to create
                a user journey map using the information that I got from the
                interview sessions.

              <h3>First Iteration.</h3>
              <p>
                Designing a user journey map was challenging for me since I have
                never designed one before. I found it to be really difficult to
                create a balance between text and graphic contents. During my
                first attempt, I planned to design the user journey what I had
                in the first iteration. Yes, it was this ugly.
