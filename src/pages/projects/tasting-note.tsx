              <p>
                LCBO is one of the world's largest alcoholic beverage
                purchasers, there are numbers of new products need to be
                evaluated each year. As a result, product consultants meet 3
                times a year to sample and document tasting notes of the new
                products.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the session, the consultants record the beverage notes in
                a given paper form after sampling each products. At the end of
                the session, the paper forms get transferred to the writing
                team, who transcripts the notes into digital format. This data
                is later used for creating product description, content for LCBO
                website and articles.

              <h3>Problems</h3>
              <p>
                Current evaluation method is labour intensive as it requires a
                significant amount of manual effort. The entire process of
                gathering, delivering paperwork and transferring data is
                <i> time consuming and fallible.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                While it's challenging for the product consultants to manage and
                organize the forms, it's a real pain for the writing team to go
                through piles of paper, validate the quality of data and
                manually enter it to electronic system.

              <h3>User Persona</h3>
              <p>
                Imagine that there are at least 15 products to be evaluated by
                10 consultants in today session. This means a minimum of 150
                copies of the evaluation forms will be generated at the end of
                session. To gain a better understanding of what the users are
                going through, a user persona is created.

              <p>After reviewing the problems and user persona, I decided to</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Choose mobile as a platform device since it's portable and
                  currently used by LCBO staff at the store.
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                  Design an application that allows product consultants to see
                  list of products that need to be evaluated, select and
                  evaluate products then submit the form electronically.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Adopt a concept of multiple choice answers to craft the user
                  experience. The users will simply tab buttons that represent
                  their answers and proceed to next questions. With this
                  approach, the users can focus on one task without having to
                  process lots of information at once.
                </li>

                {/* <li>
                  Propose that lists of products to be evaluated will need to be entered

                  be automatically stored in the central database after
                  submission.
