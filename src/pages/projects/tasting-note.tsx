                paperwork and transferring data is time consuming and fallible.
                While it's challenging for the product consultant to to manage
                and organize all the evaluation forms, it's a pain for the
                writing team to go through piles of paper, validate the quality
                of data and manually enter the notes to electronic system.{" "}

                  The beginning of one's worst nightmare: imagine that there are at least 15 products to be evaluated by
                  10 consultants in today session. This means a minimum of 150
                  copies of the evaluation forms will be generated at the end of
                  session.

                    adopt a concept of multiple choice answers to craft the user

                    their answers before proceeding to the next question. With
                    this approach, the users can focus on one task without
                    having to process lots of information at once.
