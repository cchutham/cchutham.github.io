                Craft beer is usually produced locally in small quantity by a
                small to medium-sized breweries, making it impossible for the
                breweries to supply sufficient quantity of products to LCBO
                warehouses all at once. As a result, each LCBO retail store
                needs to contact local breweries directly to place orders and
                manage shipping logistics.
              </p>
              <p>
                A store manager or beer ambassador is responsible for managing
                craft beer inventory and placing orders. Currently, the
                inventory is tracked with a spreadsheet and calculated by hand.
                Once the quantities are determined, the staff makes phone calls
                to each craft brewers to place order and arrange delivery date.
                To modify, update or check on orders, the staff has to make more
                phone calls during the week.

              <h3>Problems.</h3>
              <p>
                LCBO employees usually rely on{" "}
                <i> gut's felling and experience </i> to decide what products
                and how many of them to order. There are other factors such as
                promotion and seasonal items that can affect their estimation.
                Without a proper guidance, it is almost
                <i> impossible to order accurate number of product.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                Making phone calls back and forth is also very time consuming,
                and it doesn't only cause burden to LCBO staff. There are about
                660 LCBO across Ontario, so each brewer can receive
                <i> hundreds of phone calls</i> on Monday and the following
                days.
              </p>
              <p>
                The current process restricts order modification to be made only
                through phone calls. As a result,
                <i> unexpected quantity or products </i> can show up on the
                delivery day if the brewer forgets to update with the store.
              </p>

              <h3>User Interview.</h3>
              <p>
                Although I, as a designer, already understand the problems that
                LCBO staff and craft brewers are facing, it's still valuable for
                me to sit and chat with the users to ask questions and discover
                what kind of system that they are looking for.
              </p>
              <p>
                Form sessions, held to capture extra pieces of information from
                LCBO store employees and craft brewers, I learnt that
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    LCBO employees looked for a system that would tell them
                    exact number of product quantity needed to be ordered.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    LCBO staff would like to know an estimated delivery date
                    from the craft brewers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After receiving orders from each LCBO store, craft brewers
                    had to record order details to their system manually because
                    LCBO didn't provide any platform for them to track the order
                    history.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Craft brewers needs an ability to modify orders as sometimes
                    they couldn't keep up with production or they realized that
                    the store ordered too many or too less.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Both parties wanted to be able to communicate requests or
                    updates through the system.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </Col>

                I use the Work Breakdown Structure to make sure that all
                required components are included in the design. The system is
                mainly divided into two parts: portal for LCBO store and portal
                for craft brewers.
