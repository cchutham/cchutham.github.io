              <p>
                The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) is one of the world's
                largest purchaser of alcoholic beverages. It distributes and
                sells liquor throughout the province of Ontario in Canada. In
                2016, an innovation lab, LCBO|next, was founded to design and
                develop new technologies that will enhance LCBO's technology
                initiatives.

              <h3>My Roles</h3>
              <p>
                As a UX/UI designer at the lab, I met with stakeholders to
                discuss their problems and understand the user requirements and
                constraints. I designed a web portal that allows LCBO retail
                employees to place craft beer orders directly with brewers.

              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                Craft beer is usually produced by a small to medium size local
                breweries. This makes it impossible for the breweries to supply
                sufficient amount of products to all LCBO warehouse at once. As
                a result, each LCBO retail store needs to contact local
                breweries directly to place orders and manage shipping
                logistics.
              </p>
            </Col>
          </Row>

          <Row className="justify-content-center">
            <Col lg="10">
              <h3>Problems</h3>
              <p className={sharedStyles.quote}>
                With many factors such as promotion and seasonal items, it is
                impossible for LCBO employees to order an accurate amount of
                craft beer by just relying on their experience and gut feeling.
                Without a reliable ordering system, the process will continue to
                be time consuming and prone to error.
              </p>

              <p>
                A store manager and a beer ambassador is responsible for
                managing craft beer inventory and placing orders. Currently, the
                inventory is tracked with a spreadsheet and calculated by hand.
                To order the products, the employee needs to estimate the
                quantity before making phone calls to each craft brewer to place
                order and arrange delivery date. To modify, update or check
                orders, the staff has to make more phone calls during the week.
              </p>

              <p>
                This current process doesn't only cause a burden to LCBO staff,
                but also the craft brewers. Since there are about 660 LCBO
                stores across Ontario, each brewer can receive hundreds of phone
                calls during the week. In addition, the current process
                restricts order modification to be made only through phone
                calls. As a result, an unexpected quantity or products can show
                up on the delivery day if the brewer forgets to update with the
                store.

              <h3>User Interview</h3>
              <p className={sharedStyles.quote}>
                I know the problems the users face. I also have a picture of the
                system that I want to design to solve the problems, but I can't
                just do that. Why?
                <br />
                Because I'm not the user!
                <br />
                It doesn't make sense to design a system that I love to use, but
                the real users hate to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although I already understand the problems that LCBO staff and
                craft brewers are facing, it's still crucial for me to sit and
                chat with the users to ask questions and discover what kind of
                system that they are looking for.
              </p>
              <p>
                From interview sessions with LCBO employees and craft brewers, I
                learn that
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  LCBO employees look for a system that would tell them exact
                  number of product quantity needed to be ordered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  LCBO employees would like to know an estimated delivery date
                  from the craft brewers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After receiving orders from each LCBO store, craft brewers
                  have to record order details to their system manually because
                  LCBO doesn't provide any platform for them to track the order
                  history.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Craft brewers need an ability to modify orders as sometimes
                  they can't keep up with production or they realize that the
                  store orders too many or too less.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Both parties want to be able to make requests or updates
                  through the system.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </Col>
          </Row>
          <Row className="justify-content-center">
            <Col lg="10">
              <h3>Work Breakdown Structure</h3>
              <p>
                I use the Work Breakdown Structure to make sure that all
                required components are included in the design. The system is
                mainly divided into two parts: portal for LCBO store and portal
                for craft brewers.

                Based on my research on modern e-commerce systems, there are 3
                keys elements that exist in most of the systems:
