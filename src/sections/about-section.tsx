                  Life is hard, and technology is supposed to make it easier. My
                  mission as a product designer is not just to design products,
                  but the entire experience that sparks people’s joy and
                  simplify their lives.

                  I’m a third year Systems Design Engineering at the Univeristy
                  of Waterloo. My focus for 2018 is to keep learning UX/UI while
                  also catch up with development technology. Since the beginning
                  of the year, I’ve been pushing myself to work harder on visual
                  design skills and reading more design books. I love travelling
                  and getting inspired by exploring cultures and meeting people.
                  You can learn more about collection of my journey here. I love
                  to travel to different places around the world Travelling
                  inspires me to see the world in a broader picture and
                  understand people from different culture. Be a part of my
                  journey.
