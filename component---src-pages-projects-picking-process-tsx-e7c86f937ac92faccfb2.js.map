From the\r\n                interface below, we can see that from step 5 to step 6, the\r\n                users have an option to pick up more pallet or to drop off\r\n                pallet(s) that they currently have on their forklift.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <img\r\n                src={this.getImageUrl(\"interface.png\")}\r\n                alt=\"new interface of picking process\"\r\n                className=\"img-fluid\"\r\n              />\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"10\">\r\n              <h3>Next Steps</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                While this problem seemed to be resolved by adding a feature\r\n                that allows the forklift operator to pick up multiple pallets at\r\n                a time, there are other issues that need to be considered.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                <i>\r\n                  <b>\r\n                    \"What is the maximum number of pallets that can be picked at\r\n                    once?\"\r\n                  </b>\r\n                </i>\r\n                <br />\r\n                This question was asked by both myself and the professional\r\n                service consultants when I presented them this prototype. It's\r\n                good to allow multiple pallets to be picked at once, but some\r\n                limitation should still exist to prevent any potential error.\r\n                Still, the maximum number can be varied, depending on the\r\n                workflow of each warehouse. Some warehouses might want their\r\n                forklift operators to pick up only one pallet at a time.\r\n                Therefore, the product team still needs to consider if a single\r\n                number will be set up as a maximum number or the maximum number\r\n                can be customized by each warehouse.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                <i>\r\n                  <b>\r\n                    \"Can we redesign the entire picking process experience so\r\n                    that it's more user friendly?\"\r\n                  </b>\r\n                </i>\r\n                <br />\r\n                I consider the addition of this feature as a first step to\r\n                improve user experience for picking process. However, I was\r\n                mainly focusing to solve the pallet picking up issue, so there\r\n                was very minimal UI designs in the prototype shown in a previous\r\n                section. The current user interfaces neither have the best UI\r\n                designs nor provide the optimal user experience. As a result, a\r\n                series of design exercises was performed to explore possible\r\n                redesign options.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </ProjectLayout>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private getImageUrl(filename: string) {\r\n    return withPrefix(\r\n      `/images/${this.props.data.project.edges[0].node.imageFolder}/${filename}`\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\r\n  query PickingProcessQuery($path: String!) {\r\n    allProjects: allProjectsJson {\r\n      ...ProjectFields\r\n    }\r\n    project: allProjectsJson(filter: { url: { eq: $path } }) {\r\n      ...ProjectFields\r\n    }\r\n    mainImage: file(relativePath: { eq: \"Picking/main.png\" }) {\r\n      ...MainImageSizes\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/projects/picking-process.tsx"],"sourceRoot":""}
