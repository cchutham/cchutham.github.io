		   <br>
		   <br>
		   Hello people! Welcome again to Nail Art Mania &hearts;
		   My name is Mudmee. I currently study at Mount Douglas Secondary in Victoria, British Columbia.
		   I start painting my nails with basis styles since I was in grade seven, and now it becomes my favorite thing to do.
		   I really love to see my nails look nice and pretty, so I always
		   try to do various styles of nail art.
