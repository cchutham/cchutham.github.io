	  Special Thanks
       </div>
	   First of all, I'd like to say thank you to my mom and dad who give me money to buy all of the nail polishes
	   and also other manicure equipment.I seriously thank them for always supporting of what I'm doing and encouraging me to 
	   do what I like. I'd like to thank Ms.Wear for being an amazing teacher. Without you, I'd not be able to create 
	   this website. I also want to thank to all my classmates that help, teach and share their opinions to me throughout 
	   this project. Finally, I want to say thank you to my friends Minnie for helping with photographs and PK for giving me advices.
