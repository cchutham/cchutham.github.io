      Easy and Chick.
      <br>
      You simply need only yellow nail polish and black cracked nail polish to do this style of nail art. It's so simple and easy to do too. Apply the yellow nail polish first, wait until it completely dry then apply the black cracked nail polish on top.

      <br>
      Classy and glamorous.
      <br>
      This idea of nail arts first entered my mind when I went to prom last year. I was thinking for something basic, but classy. With the sparking and shiny pearl colored base and the glamorous gold colors on the tips, this style of nail arts become the another one of my all time favorite style.
