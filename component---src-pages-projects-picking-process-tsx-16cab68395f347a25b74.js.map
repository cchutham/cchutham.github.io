One of its core product is PackManager, a\r\n                software solution that helps brand owners and contract packagers\r\n                (“copackers”) manage production, inventory and orders. The\r\n                Product team at Nulogy is responsible for design and develop\r\n                features that will increase production efficiency and improve\r\n                overall user experience.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The warehouse picking process normally involves forklift\r\n                operators picking up items from one location and drop them off\r\n                at another location. Currently, the forklift operators can only\r\n                pick up one pallet at a time due to the restriction of the\r\n                software that Nulogy provides. This can slow down the picking\r\n                process as the forklift operators have to make multiple trips to\r\n                pick up items until they fulfill the picking list. To increase\r\n                efficiency to their workflow, I decided to review the shipping\r\n                process and designed a feature that would allow them to pick up\r\n                multiple items at once.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"10\">\r\n              <h3>User Research</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                I began my design process by interviewing Nulogy's professional\r\n                service consultants, who worked directly with the workers at the\r\n                manufacturing site. After multiple rounds of interviews, I was\r\n                able to collect sufficient information to summarize the general\r\n                workflow of the forklift operator. I then was assigned to create\r\n                a user journey map using the information that I got from the\r\n                interview sessions.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"6\">\r\n              <img\r\n                src={this.getImageUrl(\"research.jpg\")}\r\n                alt=\"whiteboard with research\"\r\n                className=\"img-fluid\"\r\n              />\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"10\">\r\n              <h3>User Journey Map / First Iteration</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Designing a user journey map was challenging for me since I've\r\n                never designed one before. With the information from interview\r\n                sessions, I planned to create a user journey map that shows\r\n                forklift operator's thoughts and his interaction with other\r\n                workers. However, I found it to be really difficult to create a\r\n                balance between text and graphic contents. As a result, this is\r\n                what it looked like in the first iteration.

Majority of graphic contents\r\n                were removed in the second iteration, making the page look a lot\r\n                cleaner than it was in the first iteration.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"8\">\r\n              <img\r\n                src={this.getImageUrl(\"2.png\")}\r\n                alt=\"second iteration of user journey map\"\r\n                className=\"img-fluid\"\r\n              />\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"10\">\r\n              <h3>User Journey Map / Third Iteration</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                In this iteration, the color scheme was changed and all the\r\n                information was put together.

From the\r\n                interface below, we can see that from step 5 to step 6, the\r\n                users have an option to pick up more pallet or to drop off\r\n                pallet(s) that they currently have on their forklift.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <img\r\n                src={this.getImageUrl(\"interface.png\")}\r\n                alt=\"new interface of picking process\"\r\n                className=\"img-fluid\"\r\n              />\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n            <Col lg=\"10\">\r\n              <h3>Next Steps</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                While this problem seemed to be resolved by adding a feature\r\n                that allows the forklift operator to pick up multiple pallets at\r\n                a time, there are other issues that need to be considered.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                <i>\r\n                  <b>\r\n                    \"What is the maximum number of pallets that can be picked at\r\n                    once?\"\r\n                  </b>\r\n                </i>\r\n                <br />\r\n                This question was asked by both myself and the professional\r\n                service consultants when I presented them this prototype. It's\r\n                good to allow multiple pallets to be picked at once, but some\r\n                limitation should still exist to prevent any potential error.\r\n                Still, the maximum number can be varied, depending on the\r\n                workflow of each warehouse. Some warehouses might want their\r\n                forklift operators to pick up only one pallet at a time.\r\n                Therefore, the product team still needs to consider if a single\r\n                number will be set up as a maximum number or the maximum number\r\n                can be customized by each warehouse.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                <i>\r\n                  <b>\r\n                    \"Can we redesign the entire picking process experience so\r\n                    that it's more user friendly?\"\r\n                  </b>\r\n                </i>\r\n                <br />I consider the addition of this feature as a first step to\r\n                improve user experience for picking process. However, I was\r\n                mainly focusing to solve the pallet picking up issue, so there\r\n                was very minimal UI designs in the prototype shown in a previous\r\n                section. The current user interfaces neither have the best UI\r\n                designs nor provide the optimal user experience. As a result, a\r\n                series of design exercises was performed to explore possible\r\n                redesign options.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </ProjectLayout>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private getImageUrl(filename: string) {\r\n    return withPrefix(\r\n      `/images/${this.props.data.project.edges[0].node.imageFolder}/${filename}`\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\r\n  query PickingProcessQuery($path: String!) {\r\n    allProjects: allProjectsJson {\r\n      ...ProjectFields\r\n    }\r\n    project: allProjectsJson(filter: { url: { eq: $path } }) {\r\n      ...ProjectFields\r\n    }\r\n    mainImage: file(relativePath: { eq: \"Picking/main.png\" }) {\r\n      ...MainImageSizes\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
